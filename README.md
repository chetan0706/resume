1. What is Neural network?
  - A neural network is a type of machine learning which models itself after the human brain. This creates an artificial neural network that via an algorithm allows the computer to learn by incorporating new data.
2. What is Deep learning?
  - Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.
3. What is Apache Spark?
  - Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning and graph processing.
3. Describe yourself.
  - I finished my undergraduate in Electrical Engineering from one of the best college of India's in 2012, then I worked for 3 years in a Electrical power transformer manucturing unit in India for 3 years then I came to USA for the graduate studies. My major was Power electonics and power system in the undergraduate. During the first semester I realised I need to shift my concentration to align the beauty of programming. I met with several advisors on campus. I secured not one but two on campus jobs, first was as a Research assistance and other was tutor for NROTC for about 1 year. Then I met my current advisor who was doing research in Machine learning. My advisor suggested me to utilize my electrical engineering background in machine learning field. Then I started looking for the data for the research. I found the useful data in Fall 2016.
  - Then, I started working on it.
  - Reading papers and studing coding.
  - I took several classes such as Machine Learning and Data mining, Coding theory,
  - Currently, I am woring in the Information and Technology Services on campus. Here, I manage Cisco Call Manager services, I use my python skills to clean and maintain the database.
  - Use shell to write bash programs
